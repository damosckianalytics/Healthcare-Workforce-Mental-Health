# Healthcare-Workforce-Mental-Health

# Overview

This project analyses the mental health of healthcare workers, focusing on stress levels, job satisfaction, burnout, workplace factors, and access to Employee Assistance Programmes (EAPs). The data is visualised in Power BI to provide insights into workforce well-being and retention challenges.

# Objectives

- Identify key factors affecting the mental health of healthcare professionals.
- Analyse the relationship between stress, job satisfaction, and burnout frequency.
- Assess the impact of workplace factors and EAPs on mental health absences.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve workforce well-being and retention.

# Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from GitHub, containing anonymised information on stress levels, job satisfaction, burnout, workplace conditions, and employee retention.

# Tools Used

- Power BI â€“ For data cleaning & preparation, data visualisation.

# Insights

- Stress levels vary significantly by job role, with critical care nurses and physicians experiencing higher stress.
- Burnout frequency strongly correlates with lower job satisfaction.
- Workplace factors such as heavy workload, poor environment, and unclear job expectations contribute to mental health absences.
- Employees with access to EAPs are more likely to remain in their roles compared to those without access.

# Key Findings

- High stress and burnout rates: Healthcare professionals, especially nurses and physicians, report high stress levels.
- Workplace conditions matter: Heavy workload and poor environment are major contributors to mental health issues.
- Job satisfaction declines with burnout: Employees experiencing frequent burnout report significantly lower job satisfaction.
- EAPs improve retention: Employees with access to EAPs are more likely to stay in their jobs.
